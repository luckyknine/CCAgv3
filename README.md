Content Creation Authoring Guide for Microsoft NetShow

This is the online version and Microsoft Word document of the Microsoft Content Creation Guide for media creation
associated with Microsoft NetShow and included in the SDK available with the product.  

This Microsoft product, NetShow, was the bassis for a high speed, streaming video/audio/illustrated audio server and 
player system.  It was successfully tested in Hong Kong, Australia, and the USA.  Due to the increase in the internet
and the lack of a viable infastructure in the USA, the product was later modified to become the Windows Media
Server/Player System available on Windows NT and later versions of Windows.

The folder, CCAGv3, contains an icon, Default.htm, that will launch the online version with all available sections 
and content.  However, many of the .ASF video clips associated with the "Hot Topics video" do not include the codec
to view correctly.  The MPEG video sample can be viewed with current available codecs.  A Microsoft Word document (.DOC)
CCAGv3.doc is also included.

Per my resume, I was the Program Manager for this product which included both conceptual design, development,  
management and the writing and design of the following sections:

Multimedia Basics
NetShow Overview
Video
Codecs
Hot Topics:
  General Know-How
  Video
